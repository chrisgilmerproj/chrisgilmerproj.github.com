<strong>Chris Gilmer</strong> is an engineer.  He attended the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">University of Colorado, Boulder</a> for his undergraduate from 1999 - 2004.  He received the degrees B.S. of Aerospace Engineering and B.A.of Astronomy during his tenure there.  He also completed a minor in Physics, setting the emphasis of his astronomy degree firmly in the field of astrophysics.

Following his years at CU he moved on to work at <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/" target="_blank">Northrop-Grumman Electronic Systems</a> in Boulder, Colorado until 2007.  During his work at Northrop-Grumman he began attending graduate courses in aerospace engineering through the <a href="http://den.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Distance Education Network</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a>.  In 2007 he moved out to Los Angeles, CA to pursue his degree as a full time student.  In May of 2008 he graduated with an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis in Control Systems Design.

Shortly after graduating, Chris began work for the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> in Pasadena, CA working as an Integration &amp; Test Engineer on the <a href="http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/" target="_blank">Mars Science Laboratory</a> project.  With the launch delay of that project to 2011 he subsequently transferred to become the lead software developer in C++ and Python for <a href="http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/1088-how-altimetry-works.php" target="_blank">CNES Altimetry</a> missions.

The next step for Chris is to attend a PhD program in Computer Science in the field of robotics.  He'd like to work in the field of robotic prostheses, swarm communication and mapping, or remote exploration.  In the meantime his focus is developing robot projects that he can post online as educational guides for others interested in hobby robotics.
