I just learned that I am a winner of the <a title="Arduino Contest Winners" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Contest-Winners/" target="_blank">Instructables Arduino Contest</a>!  I'm really excited about that.  I entered my <a title="Garduino Upgrade" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino-Upgrade-Now-with-more-Twitter/" target="_blank">Garduino Upgrade</a> project right on the deadline for this contest and I'm so proud that I got First Place with three others.  I didn't get the Grand Prize, but I did win a <a title="Meggy Jr. RGB Super Kit" href="http://evilmadscience.com/tinykitlist/100" target="_blank">Meggy Jr. RGB Super Kit</a> from <a title="Evil Mad Science Labs" href="http://evilmadscience.com/" target="_blank">Evil Mad Scientist Labs</a> along with two other great projects.  I can't wait to get my hands on this kit to see what I can make next.  Maybe I'll program my own version of Pong before deciding on what kind of mad science to do next.  Thanks to all my friends that voted for my project too!  I couldn't have done it without your help and support.
