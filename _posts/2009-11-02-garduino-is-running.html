The garduino project has hit a huge milestone today.  It actually is working autonomously!  I have the light and the pump working correctly.  It took a lot to rework the original code into something that operated correctly with my system.  I was even somewhat surprised that the original code I found even worked.  After doing some testing with the pump unhooked and with a glass of water available to trick the moisture sensor, I put some safeguards in place to ensure the pump wouldn't flood my apt. and set it running. I just hope it works.  Time will tell, but I'm very proud of where I am with this now.
