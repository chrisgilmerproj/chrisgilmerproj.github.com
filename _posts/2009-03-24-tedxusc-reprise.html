Yesterday I attended the <a href="http://stevens.usc.edu/TEDxUSC" target="_blank">TEDxUSC</a> event held at Bovard Auditorium at the University of Southern California.  It was quite an experience and one I won't soon forget.  The event ran from 1:00PM in the afternoon until about 6:30PM to be followed by a reception at Town and Gown.  The content of the talk was broken up into two sessions with a short break in between.  Let's see if I can hit some highlights.

The conference began with a bang.  A musical opening by Qi Zhang on her organ was a prelude to a complete performance later in the program.  Then out came <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(TED)" target="_blank">Chris Anderson</a>, who I later met during the break between sessions, to get us in the right mindset to explore this unique event.  USC Provost <a href="http://www.usc.edu/admin/provost/provost.html" target="_blank">C.L. Max Nikias</a> talked to us about "intellectual friction" and how to benefit from it.  <a href="http://www.janepoynter.com/" target="_blank">Jane Poynter</a>, of Biosphere 2 fame, discussed her work and her aspirations of putting plants on the moon and mars.  <a href="http://college.usc.edu/labs/manahan/home/index.html" target="_blank">Donal Manahan</a> talked about the "Blue Revolution", the idea that we can cultivate a sustainable food source from the ocean.  I also enjoyed the talk by <a href="http://www.debevec.org/" target="_blank">Paul Debevec</a> on creating photorealistic digital actors and the technology behind it.

Before the break <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Ahmad" target="_blank">Salman Ahmad</a>, lead of famous band <a href="http://www.junoon.com/" target="_blank">Junoon</a>, came out to sing to us and brought a suprise guest ... <a href="http://www.melissaetheridge.com/home/" target="_blank">Melissa Etheridge</a>!  They apparently met at Oslo and collaborated on a song called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7T6jtXyDA4" target="_blank">"Ring the Bells"</a> that they sang for us.

After the break <a href="http://www.kelleesantiago.com/" target="_blank">Kellee Santiago</a> of <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/" target="_blank">thatgamecompany</a> talked about how we communicate with the digital games in the 21st century.  I was captivated by <a href="http://tilde-nordberg.web.cern.ch/~nordberg/cv.html" target="_blank">Markus Nordberg</a> talking about the organization and personalities that were behind building the <a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/" target="_blank">Large Hadron Colider at CERN</a>.  An even more amazing talk by <a href="http://davelogan.com/" target="_blank">Dave Logan</a> followed about <a href="http://triballeadership.net/" target="_blank">Tribal Leadership</a> and how to leverage natural organization of groups.  <a href="http://vimeo.com/3830092" target="_blank">Qi Zhang</a> came out and did the complete rendition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_for_Three_Oranges_(Prokofiev)">"The Love for Three Oranges"</a>, a complete symphony piece, done solo on her Yamaha Electone organ.  And <a href="http://www.usc.edu/programs/neuroscience/faculty/profile.php?fid=45" target="_blank">Mark Humayun </a>talked about restoring sight to the blind with artificial retina.

There were three short films, <a href="http://www.valerielapointe.com/thesis.html" target="_blank">"Summer Storm"</a>, <a href="http://www.arjunrihan.com/abridged/" target="_blank">"Abridged"</a>, and "<a href="http://www.sean.conaty.net/">Breathe</a>" that were all very good.  Plus a special short done by a then student George Lucas, as a special treat.  TEDxUSC also showed recordings of <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/juan_enriquez_shares_mindboggling_new_science.html" target="_blank">Juan Enriquez</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html" target="_blank">Elizabeth Gilbert</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/aimee_mullins_prosthetic_aesthetics.html" target="_blank">Aimee Mullens</a>, <a href="http://www.natashatsakos.com/index2.html" target="_blank">Natasha Tsakos</a>, and Renny Gleason from the <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2009/" target="_blank">TED 2009</a> conference.  The last two being premiers to the TEDxUSC community.

Afterwards I headed over to the reception with friends where I got to mingle with the TEDxUSC speakers.  I played with art installations by <a href="http://mindshare-labs.com/" target="_blank">Mindshare Labs</a> and also saw a demo by the USC <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Creative Technologies</a>.

The event was great.  I tried by best to update my friends via my Twitter.  It also opened my eyes to some new ideas and things to think about.  I really hope they continue this type of program and bring it to other schools and institutions.
