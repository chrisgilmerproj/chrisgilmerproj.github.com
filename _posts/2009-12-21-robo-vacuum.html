Today at a white elephant lunch party for my work I managed to come away with a pretty fun gift.  I got a little <a title="Robo Vacum" href="http://www.woohome.com/home-gadgets/mini-robo-vacuum-for-your-kitchen-table" target="_blank">robo vacum</a> (typo intentional).  At first I thought it would be great to have a little robot vacuum running around my desk.  I've already obtained two used roombas for other projects and thought this could be fun.  But it turns out the thing is just a stylized vacuum, no robot included.

Well I figure I have two choices.  I can save this thing until next year and re-gift it at the next holiday party.  Or, even better, I can mod the thing in my free time.  I like option 2 better, personally, and have already thought about adding a little Larson scanner to give it a cylon personality, some motors and wheels to replace the arms, and a few IR sensors to give it behavioral awareness.  When you take out the vacuum it turns out there is a lot of room inside, so I could definitely do more there.  If you have ideas then let me know.
