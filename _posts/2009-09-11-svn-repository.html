In an effort to keep my work open and available I've recently put up my code online in an <a title="Subversion" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">subversion</a> (svn) repository.  You can access it at <a href="http://svn.chrisgilmer.net/" target="_blank">http://svn.chrisgilmer.net/</a>.  There you will find the <a title="Doxygen" href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" target="_blank">doxygen</a> documentation of my code.  You can then follow a link to a <a title="ViewVC" href="http://www.viewvc.org/" target="_blank">ViewVC</a> page to see what I've done with my code through all of its revisions.  Checking out my code will require a guest account that I'd have to set up upon request.

My hope is that as I develop software tools for my projects they will facilitate others in their similar projects.  I hope soon to attach an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank">open source license</a> to my code so that others will know explicitly what they can and can't use of my published code, but in general not-for-profit usage for hobby and educational pursuits are ok in my book.  For now, though, the code isn't free to distribute (I'll be sure to post when it is!).

Does this mean I want help with my code?  That may be the case in the future, but for right now the code available supports projects I'm working on (by myself or with friends) and they may be too specific for general public help.  However, I expect my code will help people that are following instructions I've developed for projects on my website or people working on similar projects of their own.
