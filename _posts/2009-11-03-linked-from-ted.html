For the last month I've been curious about people being directed to my website and have been tracking links.  To my surprise I just noticed that my blog was <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/03/inspired_by_ted.php" target="_blank">linked to from the TED Blog</a>.  If you didn't know already, I'm a huge fan of TED and try to stay up to date with the videos they've posted online.  I was terribly excited when I had the chance to attend the <a href="../2009/03/24/tedxusc-reprise/" target="_blank">TEDxUSC conference</a> back in March of this year.  Finding out that I was blogged by the people at TED really made my day.  I definitely support what they do and hope they'll continue for many years to come.
