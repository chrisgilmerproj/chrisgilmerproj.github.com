I finally added an app to my blog that allows me to publish code directly.Â  This is the <a title="SyntaxHighlighter Evolved" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a> plugin that I found through the <a title="Wordpress Plugins" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" target="_blank">Wordpress Plugin</a> page.

As an example I can print python code:

[python]
print &quot;Hello World&quot;
[/python]

I can also print c++ code:

[cpp]
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot;;
[/cpp]

While it may not look terribly impressive with my two examples, I expect that in the near future I'll be posting more code into my posts where the formatting will be more useful.  I've wanted this capability for some time but finding the right syntax highlighter for my needs took a while.  I'm quite pleased with the out-of-the-box performance and all the great options it gives me.
