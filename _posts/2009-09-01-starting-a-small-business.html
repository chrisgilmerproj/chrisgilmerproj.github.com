  bfa_ata_body_title: Starting a Small Business
---
For a little more than a year now I've been talking the ears off of my friends and family about going into business for myself.  This has always been a "someday" dream as I figured I'd need to get a PhD first and a good business plan in hand first.  Well I was talking with my friends last night and decided that there's probably no better time than the present.  Why wait to start a business if that's what you want to do?  Right?

It was suggested I take a look at the local <a title="Small Business Administration" href="http://www.sba.gov/localresources/district/ca/la/index.html" target="_blank">Small Business Administration</a> office to find resources and advice on starting up my own business.  I also think I should probably call up my friend at <a title="EXN Engineering" href="http://www.exnengineering.com/" target="_blank">EXN Engineering</a> and get some advice from him, seeing as he's been a great friend and has lots of experience with this kind of thing.  Ideally I'd like to start off as a consultant myself when I'm not working at JPL.  Hopefully that will give me some experience in the field of robotics that I am simply not getting at work and in the meantime I'll gain some business experience.

Wherever this may lead I hope it's a positive step for me.  This is something I've always wanted to do and now it's time to do it.
