On my way home from work last week I decided to stop by Radio Shack and pick up a plastic project enclosure for my <a title="Pan and Tilt Camera" href="http://wiki.chrisgilmer.net/index.php?title=Pan_and_Tilt_Camera" target="_blank">Pan and Tilt camera</a>.  Having already burnt out one Phidget and not wanting to damage another one this seemed like a great idea.  For less than $4 I picked up a nice black plastic box and brought it home for a fun weekend project.

After doing a little planning on where I wanted all the components to fit I realized I had no good way of cutting through the plastic.  This seemed like a perfect excuse for me to buy a new tool I've always wanted, a Dremel.  I went out Friday and bought myself a new Dremel XPR 400 complete with a bunch of accessories to help me start out just about any project.

With this new tool in hand I got to work on the project enclosure.  I drilled out 4 holes in the bottom of the enclosure to secure the Phidget.  With the phidget in place I positioned the servo and then cut an appropriate hole for the pan servo in the lid.  In front of that square hole I put a smaller circle to feed the wires for the tilt servo.  Finally, I took the Phidget out after measuring and cut a hole for the USB and power cables.

Once that was all done, and after cleaning the carpet of loose plastic bits (I seriously need to build a project table outside), I fit all the pieces together.  Sure enough it looked sleak and everything fit perfectly.  The last test was to hook up all the cables and see if it still worked ... and sure enough!  It not only worked great but it looked awesome at the same time.

Now all I have to do is finish cleaning up the code and then publish an Instructable for the whole project.
