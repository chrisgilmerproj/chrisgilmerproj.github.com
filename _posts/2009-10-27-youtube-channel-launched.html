Today I launched a <a title="YouTube Channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/chrisgilmerproj" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> for my project blog.  I've been posting my projects for a while now and many people have commented that they'd like to see videos, not just pictures, of the completed work.  Well now I'm going to come through on that.  I've set up the channel and soon I'll be posting videos of projects like my Arduino Mothbot, the Pan and Tilt Camera, and my soon-to-be-operational Garduino automated garden.  I really hope to get some good feeback from this, so please subscribe and check it out!
