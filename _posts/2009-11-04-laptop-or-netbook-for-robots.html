I've finally decided to lay down some money and buy a laptop/netbook for my robotics projects.  I'm looking for something that I can use to develop my robot applications and also make resident on my robots.  Most of the hardware I have available is too heavy for my smaller robot projects to cart around.  With about $500 I'm looking for something that runs linux, is light weight, and has enough processing power to run my OpenCV projects.  I'd also love if it had a serial port, but that's not strictly necessary.  I'd love to get some advice on what to get from anyone in the community with this experience.
