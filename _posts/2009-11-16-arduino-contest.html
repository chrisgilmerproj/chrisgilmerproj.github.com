<p>One of the driving factors in getting my garden project done this last weekend was my desire to enter the <a title="Instructables Arduino Contest" href="http://www.instructables.com/contest/arduino/" mce_href="http://www.instructables.com/contest/arduino/" target="_blank">Instructables Arduino Contest</a>.&nbsp; This contest was for projects employing the Arduino IDE in an Instructable project and the prizes are pretty cool, including an Arduino Mega!&nbsp; I really wanted to compete and see if I could not only win but get some recognition for this project, so I tied up all the loose ends and submitted my project Saturday.</p>
<p>Shortly after submitting I got an email saying that the website was going to Feature my project on the site!&nbsp; This is the second time I've been featured by Instructables, the first being the Mothbot, and I'm really proud.</p>
<p>Well, now it's time for the public to vote on the projects submitted to the Arduino Contest and I thought I'd let all my friends know.&nbsp; If you'd like to help out you can <a title="Garduino Upgrade" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino-Upgrade-Now-with-more-Twitter/" mce_href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino-Upgrade-Now-with-more-Twitter/" target="_blank">visit my instructable and vote</a>.&nbsp; I hope I win, but even if I don't this will be a good experience and I plan to keep on making more projects.&nbsp; But my fingers are crossed!</p>
