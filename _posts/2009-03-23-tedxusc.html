Today I will be attending the <a href="http://stevens.usc.edu/TEDxUSC" target="_blank">TEDxUSC Conference</a>.  This is an independently organized <a href="http://www.TED.com" target="_blank">TED event</a> being put on by the <a href="http://stevens.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Stevens Institute</a> at USC.  I'll be attending with several engineering friends of mine that all study in different fields.

I discovered TED, which stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design, while using <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a> during my winter break between 2007 and 2008.  At the time they had released about a hundred or more videos of people who had presented at the conference about ideas they are passionate about.  TED's motto is "Ideas worth sharing" and they've done just that.  You can find a presentation on just about any topic that your passionate about on TED.

About a month ago a friend of mine forwarded an email about the TEDxUSC conference and I jumped on the opportunity to go.  Throughout the day I'll take notes or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and will write more about my experience here.
