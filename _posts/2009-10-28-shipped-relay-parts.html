My relay parts shipped and arrived today from SparkFun.  I only waited two days, pretty fast don't you think?  I'm going to use them in my garduino project.  This is the last piece to get everything up and running this weekend so that I can actually grow some plants.  I even bought an extra set of parts in case I want to use one for another, future project.  Come back soon as I expect I'll post pictures of putting it all together.
