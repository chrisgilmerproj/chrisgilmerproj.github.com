Last month <a title="Make Magazine" href="http://makezine.com/" target="_blank">Make Magazine</a> came out with <a title="Volume 18: ReMake America" href="http://makezine.com/18/" target="_blank">"Volume 18: ReMake America"</a> to my joy and delight.  The magazine was entirely focused on the type of home projects to help you live a greener life.  Since I moved to my new apartment I've been looking to do a few new green projects, like growing a garden and watching my power consumption.

Fortunately for me there were two great projects that fit just those ideas within the pages of the issue.  The first was the <a title="Garduino" href="http://makezine.com/18/garduino/" target="_blank">Garduino</a> (<a title="Gardening + Arduino Instructable" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Garduino_Gardening_Arduino/" target="_blank">Gardening + Arduino</a>), a really great way to automate your home garden.  This is perfect for me because A) I have a greenish-brown thumb, and B) I own an arduino!  Plus, my friend Mike and I have been talking about building a similar project of late and this was the perfect excuse.  I've already gone out to buy a basil plant and a mint plant and fitted it with a soil moisture sensor so I'm on my way.

The second project that I found interesting was the <a title="Tweet-a-Watt" href="http://makezine.com/18/tweetawatt/" target="_blank">Tweet-a-Watt</a> (<a title="Tweet-a-Watt at LadyAda.net" href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/tweetawatt/" target="_blank">A LadyAda.net project</a>).  This project is a great way to modify a home power meter to wirelessly gather data on your power consumption.  In this particular instance the data is sent out to a <a title="twitter tweetawatt" href="http://twitter.com/tweetawatt" target="_blank">twitter account</a> that the user can use to keep an eye on their power.  I like the idea because its a great way to learn about my power consumption and also learn about the <a title="Xbee RF Module" href="http://www.digi.com/products/wireless/point-multipoint/xbee-series1-module.jsp" target="_blank">Xbee RF Module</a>.

What's this all going to come to?  I'm not sure yet, but I have an idea.  It turns out I can get data from the xbee from my serial port and interact with it using python.  This can be done using the <a title="PySerial Library" href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">pyserial library</a>.  Then, with some help from the Tweet-a-Watt project, I can hook up my garden and keep tabs on it using my home computer!  What a great way to put two projects together.  My only real question is whether I should use the <a title="Xbee Adapter Kit" href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=29&amp;products_id=126" target="_blank">Xbee adapter kit</a> or the <a title="Xbee Shield Kit" href="http://www.nkcelectronics.com/freeduino-arduino-xbee-shield-kit.html" target="_blank">Xbee shield kit</a> for the arduino.

I'm excited to be working on a new project at home.  This one will take some well known projects and push me to try a few new tricks with them.  I expect to learn a lot and to apply what I learn to some future projects I see coming down the road.  But for now I can look forward to hitting the hardware store this weekend and picking up parts for my garden.  This is going to be a lot of fun.
