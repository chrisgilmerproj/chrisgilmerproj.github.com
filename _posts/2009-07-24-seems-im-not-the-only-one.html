A while back I wrote about using mobile phones for disease detection.  <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/07/24/1440227/Use-Your-Cell-Phone-To-Diagnose-Blood-Diseases" target="_blank">Seems I'm not the only one</a>.  A group out of Berkeley had the same idea and have done some great stuff with it.  The attachment to the phone is fairly big and it <a href="http://io9.com/5318989/use-your-cell-phone-to-diagnose-blood-diseases" target="_blank">checks for blood diseases</a>, but in principal it's the same idea.  I'm glad to know someone out there is putting mobile technology to good use.
