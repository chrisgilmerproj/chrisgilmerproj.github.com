Today I received my new Fluke digital multi-meter in the mail!  I'm very excited by this because I've wanted a good multi-meter for a while now.  They come in handy for all sorts of projects, especially when you're trying to reverse engineer something you think is really interesting and have no idea how it works.  I've also had some occasions recently when I've wanted to calibrate analog readings more precisely, like with my garduino project, and this will definitely help.  Just one more great tool every engineer ought to have and I've got to thank my Dad for getting it for me.  It's a great present.
