My <a href="http://wiki.chrisgilmer.net/" target="_blank">Project Wiki</a> is now up and running.  In this blog I'll discuss what I'm doing on a project and as I work on it the information will be available in my publicly readable wiki.  People I collaborate with will also have the ability to contribute on that wiki toward completing some of these projects.  Check the Projects page if you want direct links to my current and future projects.
