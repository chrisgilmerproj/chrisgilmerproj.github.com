I've wanted to cross post my entries to my personal <a title="LiveJournal" href="http://www.livejournal.com" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a> account now for quite some time.  Thanks to the <a title="LJ-XP" href="http://www.lj-xp.com/" target="_blank">LJ-XP (LiveJournal CrossPoster)</a> plugin for my Wordpress blog I can finally do that!  Now I can share my projects with all my friends.  Hopefully they'll enjoy some of the projects I've posted about.  I haven't quite figured out if I want comments from my LiveJournal to end up on my blog or back at LJ, so I guess I'll have to see how my friends and I feel about it over the next couple weeks.
