Today I did some work and got my computer to upload programs to my arduino wirelessly using Xbee chips! It took a little doing, and adding a lot of programs to my computer, but I got it all done.  Thank goodness I still have a windows machine as the tutorials I used didn't have any compatibility for OSX or linux.  You can read about how I did this <a href="http://wiki.chrisgilmer.net/index.php?title=Arduino_Xbee_Adapter" target="_blank">project over on my wiki</a>.

The next big step for me is to see if I can't get my arduino to talk back to my computer over the same wireless connection.  If I can do that then maybe I can post some of the results to a website and keep tabs on my projects.  I'm pretty excited about the whole thing, as you might be able to tell, so check back for more soon!
