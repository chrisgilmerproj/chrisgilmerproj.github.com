I've wanted to put up photos for this website in a more accessible manner for quite some time now.  After doing some research, and trying to host my own photo gallery, I decided that it was time to move to <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.  I know of several hobbyists and professionals who use Flickr to publish their photos and to post them in their blogs.  I especially like the ability to tag important areas on each photo with extra text and explanation.  With all that in mind I removed my old project gallery and signed up to make my own <a title="Project Photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisgilmerproj" target="_blank">chrisgilmerproj Flickr</a> repository.  Hopefully this is the last piece in the puzzle of creating a useful project website to capture what I'm doing and to act as a portfolio of my work.
